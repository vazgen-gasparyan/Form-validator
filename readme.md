### Hello:wave: World!
##### This is my first flask application and it is installed on Heroku:computer:.

###### You can see it at this link: https://my-flask-register.herokuapp.com/ :dizzy:

The application is **secure** and does not store your data in the database, the entered data is used only once. It *validates* the data and informs you about it.

If you want to use the code, to run it you need to put your *SECRET_KEY* in the code in the **app.py** file.
